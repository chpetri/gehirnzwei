	– 2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops)

- SSD ([[Solid-state_drive_(SSD)]] )
	- All solid **nothing** spinning or moving
	- way faster then Magnetic Disk,lesser latency
	- same 2.5 form factor so easyly replace Magnetic Disk

- [[M.2]] SSD

	- very modular, plug and play if slot exist
	- no [[SATA]] or Power cables
