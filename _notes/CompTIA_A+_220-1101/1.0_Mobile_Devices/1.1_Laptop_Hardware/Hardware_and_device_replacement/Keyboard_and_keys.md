+ Most used Component of the Laptop
	+ **easy** to replace in **most** cases
	+ Most of the time just a few screws
	
+ USB-Keyboard can be a workaround if the built-in is nonfunctional

+ As The Devices become smaller, Keyboard Spaces and Layouts vary (f.e. fn key etc)
	+ So most of the time there are multible funcitions on one key

+ Some laptops may require  **Special** tools 
+ Always stay alongside the Instructions from the manufacturer - BREAKING stuff is very easy here
